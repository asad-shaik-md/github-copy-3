## What's in this package?

This package contains a standalone executable version of the Jain University Attendance Checker that can run on any computer without requiring Python installation.

### Files included:
- `JainAttendanceChecker` (or `JainAttendanceChecker.exe` on Windows) - The main executable
- `README_DISTRIBUTION.md` - This file

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites (Target Computer):
1. **Chrome browser must be installed** - Download from https://www.google.com/chrome/
2. **Internet connection** - Required to access Jain University portal
3. **No Python installation needed** - Everything is bundled in the executable

### Running the application:

#### On macOS/Linux:
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the folder containing the executable
3. Run: `./JainAttendanceChecker`

#### On Windows:
1. Double-click `JainAttendanceChecker.exe`
2. Or run from Command Prompt: `JainAttendanceChecker.exe`

## How it works

1. **Launch**: The program opens Chrome browser automatically
2. **Manual Login**: You'll need to manually:
   - Enter your College ID
   - Enter your Date of Birth  
   - Solve the CAPTCHA
   - Click Login
3. **Automatic Processing**: Once logged in, the program automatically:
   - Navigates to attendance page
   - Extracts attendance data for all subjects
   - Calculates percentages
   - Shows detailed results

## Features

- âœ… **Fully automated** - No need to manually navigate through pages
- âœ… **Standalone** - Works without Python installation
- âœ… **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- âœ… **Real-time results** - Shows attendance percentage for each subject
- âœ… **Color-coded status** - Green/Yellow/Red based on attendance levels
- âœ… **Detailed breakdown** - Shows conducted vs attended classes

## Attendance Status Levels

- ðŸŸ¢ **Good (75%+)**: Attendance is sufficient
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning (65-74%)**: Needs attention
- ðŸ”´ **Critical (<65%)**: Urgent action required

## Troubleshooting

### "Chrome not found" error:
- Install Chrome browser from https://www.google.com/chrome/
- Restart the application

### "Permission denied" error (macOS):
1. Right-click the executable â†’ Open
2. Or run: `chmod +x JainAttendanceChecker`

### Antivirus blocking (Windows):
- Add the executable to antivirus whitelist
- This is a common false positive with packaged Python applications

### Slow startup:
- First run is slower as it extracts bundled files
- Subsequent runs will be faster

## File Size
- Typical size: ~150-200 MB
- Large size is due to bundled Python interpreter and all dependencies

## Security & Privacy

- âœ… **Local processing** - All data processing happens on your computer
- âœ… **No data collection** - No personal information is stored or transmitted
- âœ… **Read-only access** - Only reads attendance data, makes no changes
- âœ… **Standard web access** - Uses same login process as browser
